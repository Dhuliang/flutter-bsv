/**
 * Script
 * ======
 *
 * Script is the scripting language built into bitcoin. The Script class lets
 * you create an instance of a script, e.g. for a scriptSig or a scriptPubKey.
 * It understands both the binary format, as well as two different string
 * formats. The default string format, to/fromString, is a custom format only
 * used by Yours Bitcoin because it is isomorphic to the binary format (or as
 * isomorphic as it can be ... since OP_0 and OP_FALSE have the same byte
 * value, and so do OP_1 and OP_TRUE). The bitcoind string format is also
 * support, but that format is not isomorphic (i.e., if you pull in a string
 * and then write it again, you are likely to get back a different string, even
 * if you don't use OP_0, OP_FALSE, OP_1, or OP_TRUE).
